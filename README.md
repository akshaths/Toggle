###ABOUT
Tetrament is a combination of the games Tetris and Boggle. 

Control the falling pieces with the WASD or arrow keys. As your pieces fall to the floor, Tetris-style, drag your mouse along the letters of the blocks to form words, Boggle-style. You may only move your cursor to adjacent letters that are also **occupied by a Tetris block**. You can gain points by clearing lines with the Tetris blocks and/or making words (longer words are worth bonus). 

Don't let the blocks reach the top of the screen!

###CONTROLS
``W / ↑``: Rotate piece clockwise  
``A / ←``: Move piece left  
``S / ↓``: Move piece downwards  
``D / →``: Move piece right  
``Space``: Instant drop  
``Mouse``: Click and drag to form words 

###NEXT STEPS
* add demo to showcase gameplay
* add local highscores list
* implement multiplayer functionality (similar to Wordament rounds/leaderboard)
* dynamic letter insertions, insert new row of letters at the top of the board when user clears a row
