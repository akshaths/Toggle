# TOGGLE

## [PLAY TOGGLE](http://akshaths.github.io/Toggle/)

## About
Toggle is a combination of the games Tetris and Boggle. 

Control the falling pieces with the WASD or arrow keys. As your pieces fall to the floor, Tetris-style, drag your mouse along the letters of the blocks to form words, Boggle-style. You may only move your cursor to adjacent letters (diagonals neighbors count!). You can gain points by clearing lines with the Tetris blocks and/or making words (longer words are worth bonus). 

Don't let the blocks or the letters reach the top of the screen!

## Controls
``W / ↑`` · rotate piece clockwise  
``A / ←`` · move piece left  
``S / ↓`` · move piece downwards  
``D / →`` · move piece right  
``Space`` · instant drop  
``Mouse`` · click and drag to form words
